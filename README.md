# (Deprecated) WebARMap

## Instruction

This is an experimental map application that runs on the web browser.

![demo](https://github.com/ttak0422/WebARMap/blob/upload_images/demo.gif)

## Usage

This application works using `Three.ar.js`. So, this application runs only on the [WebARonARKit](https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARKit)/~~[WebARonARCore](https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARCore).~~

Sorry, this project is currently using `webkitCompassHeading` to determine the azimuth of the device. So it does not support Android device now.
Please wait a little more because we can think of a method that can be used with Android device with higher accuracy.
